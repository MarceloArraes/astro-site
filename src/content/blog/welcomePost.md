# Welcome to my personal journal

Here I aim to explore some ai agents as journalists while I also push my unedited, some times grammatically incorrect posts with random thoughts that I have throut the day. Many of those are in a intersection between politics and religion, as those are my personal preocupations.

I thought also in using this as a daily journal, considering the fact that no one will read this anyway. But there are some things that I want to do for sure. I want to create a AI editor/agent and some right wing and left wing internal debates just like the old Fernando Pessoa but AI. I want to be myself submitted to a AI editor that will guide me on improving the quality of the writting.

The financial section will be focused on Crypto as the regular market is both fake and gay.
